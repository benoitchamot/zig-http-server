# HTTP Server in Zig
## Purpose
Not much purpose, only a way for me to explore Zig and build something new.
- This is inspired by: https://www.openmymind.net/TCP-Server-In-Zig-Part-1-Single-Threaded/
- It is a step-by-step port of my previous implementation in Python: https://github.com/benoitchamot/python-http-server
